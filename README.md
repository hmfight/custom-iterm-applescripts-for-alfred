# custom-iterm-applescripts-for-alfred
This repository contains custom Applescripts that can be put into the Alfred --> Features --> Terminal --> Custom section to enable the correct operation of iTerm with Alfred.

Unfortunately as many people will know, when iTerm's Applescript functionality changes it can often break integration with Alfred.

### Note: Check your iTerm version (`iTerm2` → `About iTerm2`) and follow the instructions corresponding to your version below.

## How to install the scripts
### Video instructions
Check out the official YouTube video, it will give you a quick two and a half minute rundown.
